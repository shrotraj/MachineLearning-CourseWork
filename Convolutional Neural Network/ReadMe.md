Humans can easily identify if a person is a female or a male with high accuracy,
and also roughly tell his/her age. Now given a large labelled training dataset,
the computer can also do the gender classification and age estimation. Your task
is to build and train your deep learning models for both gender classification
and age estimation on a given training dataset with GPU in Google Colab.
