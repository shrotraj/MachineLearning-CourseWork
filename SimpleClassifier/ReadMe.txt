For this part of the exercise we will be classifying skin. Specifically, when you take a photograph some pixels are of peoples skin, others are not (e.g. they might be part of a mug of coffee). The machine learning task is to learn a classifier that identifies which pixels are skin and which are not given many exemplars. In a real application a digital camera may use this as a first step in finding peoples faces, so that is can focus on them or avoid taking photos when people blink.
